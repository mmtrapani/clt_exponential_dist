# Visualization of the Central Limit Theorem with the Exponential Distribution as the underlying population distribution
This program will generate random samples of size n from the exponential distribution with mean mu. The computer will
run 1,000 such samples. In each sample, the computer will calculate the sample mean. Next, it'll average the 1,000
sample means and find the variance of the 1,000 sample means. Finally, the program will display the observed sample mean
and variance against the theoretical sample mean and variances. A relative frequency histogram will be displayed to show
the shape of the data.
